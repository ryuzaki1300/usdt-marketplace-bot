# 📦 USDT Trading Bot – Telegram Client

A Telegram-based peer-to-peer USDT marketplace bot

This repository contains the Telegram Bot Application, responsible for user interaction, step-by-step trading flows, role-based menu navigation, and communication with the Core Backend Service.
All persistent business logic (Orders, Offers, Deals, KYC, Roles) is handled by the Core app — the bot focuses exclusively on UX and conversation flow.

## 🚀 Business Purpose

The bot enables users to safely trade USDT in a peer-to-peer manner inside Telegram.

**Users can:**
- Create Buy/Sell orders
- View market orders
- Submit offers on other users' orders
- Manage their own orders & offers
- Complete verified KYC
- Edit profile information

**Admins can:**
- Review & approve KYC requests
- Manage open deals
- Access deal archives
- View users list & statuses

Orders are automatically shared in a public Telegram channel, allowing all users to discover new opportunities.

The system is intentionally simple for MVP phase, with manual admin supervision and no automatic payments.

  types/
    session.ts             // GrammY session (wizard) type definitions
```

**Why this structure?**
- `handlers/` holds core interaction logic
- `conversations/` stores step-by-step workflows
- `messages/` & `keyboards/` centralize UI for easy editing
- `coreClient.ts` isolates Core API communication
- `env.ts` ensures safe environment variable validation
- `session.ts` prevents wizard state bugs thanks to strict typing

 │    - Update optional details
 └── Request KYC
      - Enter full name
      - Approve Telegram phone number

```

Users must pass KYC before:

---

### 🟧 Creating New Order

Wizard steps:
1. Choose side (Buy / Sell)
2. Enter amount (USDT)
3. Enter price per unit
4. Enter network (TRC20 / ERC20 / TON …)
5. Optional description
6. Summary review
7. Confirm → Bot sends order to Core
8. Bot posts order into public channel

---

### 🟪 Creating a New Offer

1. Select order
2. Enter offered price per unit
3. Optional comment
4. Maker receives Accept/Decline choice
5. If accepted → Core creates a Deal
6. Admin handles Deal in Admin Menu

---

### 🟥 Admin Menu (Role-based)

```
Admin Menu
 ├── KYC List        → Approve/Reject KYC requests
 ├── Open Deal       → Manage active deals
 ├── Deal Archive    → View old completed/cancelled deals
 └── Users List      → View roles, KYC status, profile info
```

---

## 📢 Public Order Channel

Every order created by a user is automatically posted to a public Telegram channel.

The channel ID must be configured inside `.env`:

```env
PUBLIC_ORDER_CHANNEL=-1001234567890
```

If posting fails, the bot logs the error but still confirms order creation.

---

## 🔌 Accessing the Core App

The bot communicates with the Core Backend using HTTP requests with headers:

- `x-api-key`
- `x-telegram-user-id`

### Required Environment Variables

```env
CORE_API_KEY=your_key
CORE_BASE_URL=https://your-core-app.com
PUBLIC_ORDER_CHANNEL=-1001234567890
```

### Core Documentation

(Replace with real documentation URL):
👉 **Core API Docs:** https://example.com/core-docs

The bot does NOT handle business logic — it delegates everything to Core.

---

## ⚠️ Important Development Notes

### 1. The bot is stateless

Only temporary wizard data is stored via GrammY session.

### 2. All UI text is centralized

Located in `src/ui/messages/` — this makes maintenance, translations, and future design changes very easy.

### 3. Session only manages bot flow

Not suitable for long-term business logic — that lives in Core.

### 4. Role detection for Admin Menu

Bot must always check user's role from Core before showing admin menu.

### 5. Public channel posting is critical

Any change to message format should remain consistent for users.
